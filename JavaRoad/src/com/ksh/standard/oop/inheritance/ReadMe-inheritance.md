#Inheritance
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.


e.g every class in java automatically extends java.lang.Object class. is called Is-A relationship.

```
class Bicycle extends Object{

}

```
 
Terminology:
Super Class, Sub class and Reusability.
Object is SuperClass, Bicycle is subclass.
